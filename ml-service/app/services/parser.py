"""Resume text -> structured JSON. Extraction only, no reasoning about fit
or quality — that happens in the deterministic stages downstream
(normalizer, matcher, ats_score, gap_analysis).

Two backends are available, selected by Settings.parser_backend:
"local" (default) runs a resume-NER model fully offline, no API key or
network call needed (see local_ner_parser.py); "llm" sends the resume text
to whichever provider llm_provider selects (Groq/Gemini) and asks it to
return the JSON directly. The LLM backend is opt-in since it costs money and
depends on outbound network access; it's kept for cases the local model
handles poorly (e.g. needing the free-text job description field, which the
local backend never fills in).
