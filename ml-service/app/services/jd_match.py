"""JD-targeted match (FR-8.1/8.2): how well an already-extracted skill set
covers one pasted job description. Deterministic and offline, like the role
matcher it sits next to -- the JD's skills are found by dictionary matching
against both taxonomies (no LLM, no network), so the same JD and the same
resume always give the same score, and every point of it is explainable as
"you have these, you are missing those".

Score = 0.6 * coverage + 0.4 * similarity, rounded to 2 dp:
  coverage   -- share of the JD's recognised skills the candidate has
                exactly (what a recruiter's keyword screen measures);
  similarity -- cosine between the mean skill embeddings of the two sets,
                which gives partial credit for near-synonyms coverage
                misses ("PostgreSQL" against a JD that says "SQL").
The weights favour coverage because the missing list is the actionable
output; similarity keeps a resume with the right vocabulary from scoring
zero on a JD phrased differently.
