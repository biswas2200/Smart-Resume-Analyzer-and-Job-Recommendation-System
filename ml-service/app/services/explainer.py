"""Turns already-computed scores/matches into a readable explanation. Two
backends, selected by Settings.explainer_backend (default "template", per

the already-computed data; the LLM backend asks a coaching-framed model for a
more polished narrative. Neither ever rewrites resume content or influences
the underlying score (FR-5.3) -- the LLM backend is Premium/opt-in, since it
costs money, needs network access, and (unlike the template) is not
