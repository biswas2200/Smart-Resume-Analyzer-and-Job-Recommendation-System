"""Job recommendations: which open jobs suit a resume, and why. Deterministic
and offline like the role matcher -- dictionary skill extraction and the
pinned MiniLM embedder, no LLM -- so the same resume and the same jobs always
rank the same way, and every score is explainable.

Each job's skills are extracted ONCE (extract_job_skills), when the backend
stores the posting, with the same extractor the JD match uses. Ranking then
compares those stored skills with the resume's:

  coverage   -- share of the job's skills the resume has exactly
                (what a recruiter's keyword screen measures);
  similarity -- cosine between the mean skill embeddings of the two sets
                (partial credit for near-synonyms: "PostgreSQL" vs "SQL");
  role_fit   -- how close the job title is to the candidate's best-matched
                catalogue roles (a "Backend Engineer" resume and an
                "SDE II - Payments" title).

score = 0.45 * coverage + 0.30 * similarity + 0.25 * role_fit. A job whose
description yielded no skill we recognise is ranked on its title alone, at
0.5 * role_fit, so an unreadable posting never outranks a well-matched one.
