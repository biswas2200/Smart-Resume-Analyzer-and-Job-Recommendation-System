"""Loads the weights snapshot the backend's admin export endpoint publishes
(SRS FR-7.5: {snapshot_id, created_at, sha256, weights: {role: {skill:
weight}}}), so matcher.py can compute each role's *weighted* skill vector
(FR-3.2) instead of a plain mean -- see docs/editions-and-parity.md §2 and
docs/lld.md §7.4.

A missing file or a missing (role, skill) entry both fall back to weight
1.0, matching the backend's SkillVectorService.DEFAULT_WEIGHT -- so a role or
skill with no EMA history yet still counts in the match, just without any
learned emphasis, and the engine runs identically with or without a snapshot
ever having been placed in app/data/ (the Community Edition default).
