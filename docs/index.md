# Coverlay: documentation

An AI-assisted resume analyser and career recommendation system. Its core engine is deterministic: local NER extraction, taxonomy normalization, embedding-based skill-to-role matching and rule-based ATS scoring. An LLM is used in two optional places, a coaching narrative in the Premium tier and an opt-in extraction path. It never rewrites resumes and never produces a score.

The product is a hosted cloud platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with two tiers, Web Free and Web Premium. Both share one deterministic core engine and call Google Vertex AI (Gemini) for the 22 non-engineering domains and for Premium coaching narratives. The original offline, self-hosted distribution is archived in [`docs/archive/community-edition.md`](archive/community-edition.md). [Result Determinism & Parity](editions-and-parity.md) covers the deterministic engine design, and [SRS v2.0](srs.md) the requirements.

These docs live under `docs/` and are built with MkDocs (see the last section).

## Project status

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| ML service (`ml-service/`): extraction (local NER; Gemini via ADC for non-engineering Premium), domain detection, normalization, matching (per-domain catalogues), ATS scoring, gap analysis, explanation, DOCX + PDF | Implemented, tested (`pytest tests/`) |
| Backend (`backend/`, Spring Boot): JWT auth, RBAC roles, admin upgrade path, resume upload + MinIO storage, re-analysis, recommendations with domain/lock state, feedback, EMA skill-vector update | Implemented |
| Frontend (`frontend/`, HTML + Bootstrap 5 + vanilla JS): upload, dashboard (domain badge, locked card, re-analyse), recommendations, feedback, tier badge | Implemented |
| Career OS domain split: engineering free on the local engine; 12 other domains Premium on Gemini (ADC); `engine`/`tier` per domain in `domains.json` | Implemented (MVP, 2026-09-14) |
| Core-engine parity work: template explainer, pinned ONNX models, engine fingerprint, 2-dp rounding | Planned (step 1) |
| Restaged pipeline: sectioner, dictionary skills, precomputed vector tables | Planned (step 2) |
| Weights snapshot export / consumption | Planned (step 3) |
| Community Edition Docker image + CLI | Archived, paused in favor of GCP cloud hosting ([details](archive/community-edition.md)) |
| Tier gating (Free vs Premium) | Implemented for explanation, history, non-engineering recommendations; payments planned |
| Golden parity suite in CI | Planned (step 6) |
| Training pipeline (`ml-service/training/`) | Planned (step 7): cloud training on GCP (Compute Engine / Vertex AI) |
